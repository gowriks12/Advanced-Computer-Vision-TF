# Advanced-Computer-Vision-TF
Assignments related to advanced computer vision using tensorflow course on coursera.

I am glad to have taken up a course on Advanced Computer Vision with TensorFlow with DeepLearning.ai through Coursera. It was a very insightful journey where I got some useful hands-on experience with TensorFlow and Computer Vision. The concepts discussed included transfer learning, object recognition, image segmentation and identifying the saliency of the classification by visualizing. Through the weekly assignments and ungraded labs, I was able to work with some of the pre-trained networks like ResNet50, VGG16, MobileNetV2, TensorFlow's object detection APIs.
I would like to thank the instructor Laurence Moroney for explaining all the concepts clearly and in detail. I am more than excited to be using the learnings from this course in my Masters thesis revolving around computer vision applications.
